# Getting started

The frontend is a React app, built with Vite. Install the dependencies with:

```sh
yarn install
```

Launch a local development build in your browser with:

```sh
yarn start
```

Build the production app, and serve it locally, with:

```sh
yarn build
yarn serve
```

## Tests

Components are tested with Storybook and Vitest. Open a development Storybook (including a GUI for running tests) in your default browser with:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

Run the tests from the command line with:

```sh
yarn test
```

Run the linter (included with the tests):

```sh
yarn lint
```
