# What is the PKPDApp

It's a web application for modeling the distribution and effects of drugs. It is currently in its infancy, but we plan to build an application with an intuitive user interface for

- creating pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and PKPD models,

- creating statistical, population models 

- exploring the properties drug models by forward simulation for different
  - parameter regimes
  - different dosing schedules and administration routes
  - different population models
  - different noise models

- finding the best model for a given dataset

If you are interested and would like to contribute to the project, you are welcome to drop me an email. Especially at a later stage of the project, when the basic architecture of the app is sorted out, contributions will be very welcome.
