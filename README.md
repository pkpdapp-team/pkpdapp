# What is the PKPDApp?

It's a web application for modeling the distribution and effects of drugs. It is currently in its infancy, but we plan to build an application with an intuitive user interface for

- creating pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and PKPD models,

- creating statistical, population models 

- exploring the properties of drug models by forward simulation for different
  - parameter regimes
  - different dosing schedules and administration routes
  - different population models
  - different noise models

- finding the best model for a given dataset

At heart of the app is it to provide a best-practice pipeline for PKPD modeling that will make it easier to compare different modelling strategies. 

## Contributing to the PKPDApp

The PKPDApp is under heavy development and many things still have to be figured out. If you are nevertheless interested to contribute, please don't hesitate to get in touch. First guidelines and an overview of the development structure of the PKDPApp can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)
