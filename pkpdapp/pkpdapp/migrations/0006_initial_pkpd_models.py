Tumour growth inhibition pharmacodynamic model introduced by Koch et al. in
[1]_.  In this model the tumour growth inhibition is modelled by an empirical
model of the tumour volume :math:`V_T` over time
.. math::
    \frac{\text{d}V_T}{\text{d}t} =
        \frac{2\lambda_0\lambda_1 V_T}
        {2\lambda_0V_T + \lambda_1} - \kappa C V_T.
Here, the tumour growth in absence of the drug is assumed to grow
exponentially at rate :math:`2\lambda_0` for tumour volumes below some
critical volume :math:`V_{\text{crit}}`. For volumes beyond
:math:`V_{\text{crit}}` the growth dynamics is assumed to slow down
and transition to a linear growth at rate :math:`\lambda_0`. The tumour
growth inhibitory effect of the compound is modelled proportionally to
its concentration :math:`C` and the current tumour volume. The
proportionality factor :math:`\kappa` can be interpreted as the potency
of the drug.
Note that the critical tumour volume :math:`V_{\text{crit}}` at which
the growth dynamics transitions from exponential to linear growth is
given by the two growth rates
.. math::
    V_{\text{crit}} = \frac{\lambda _1}{2\lambda _0}.
