# Creates views that can be called by mapping them to urls.
#
# Each view is responsible for one of two things: return HttpResponse, or
# raising exception Http404.
#
# All functionality of the of the webpage lies within the views. They can
# can be used to read records from database, use a template system, or use
# any other third party python package.
#
# NOTE: Always separate functions from design by using templates. This makes
# webpage more modular and easier to update and maintain.
